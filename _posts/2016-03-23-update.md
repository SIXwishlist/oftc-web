  * The CA used to sign our IRC server certificates, SPI, has been removed from
    Debian's (and other's) ca-certificates package. This means users will now
    be seeing "self-signed certificate in certificate chain" errors or
    experiencing similar problems with SSL connections.

    We are moving to <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>
    certificates, but have yet to complete testing our processes.

    To work around the problem until we have new certificates, manually import
    the <a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/ca/spi-cacert.crt">spi-cacert.crt</a>
    certificate into your system's or IRC client's trust store.
