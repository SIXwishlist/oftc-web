# <center>Welcome to OFTC!</center> #

The Open and Free Technology Community aims to provide stable and effective collaboration services to members of the community in any part of the world, while
closely listening to their needs and desires.

OFTC was founded at the end of 2001 by a group of experienced members of the Open Source and Free Software communities aiming to provide these communities with better communication, development, and support infrastructure.

OFTC is a member project of [Software in the Public Interest](http://www.spi-inc.org/), a non-profit organization which was founded to help organizations develop and distribute open hardware and software.
