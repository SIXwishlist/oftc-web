# OFTC Departments #

Responsibilities for managing OFTC are delegated into loosely-defined "departments". The following departments exist:

## Infrastructure Department ##

The Infrastructure Department is responsible for managing OFTC's servers (dedicated and not), as well as OFTC's IRC network and any other services that OFTC offers to members or the public at large.

Currently the Infrastructure Department is made up of:

 * Joerg Jaspert (Ganneff)
 * Martin Zobel-Helas (zobel)
 * Christoph Berg (Myon)

## Coding Department ##

The Coding Department is responsible for maintaining codebases specific to OFTC (such as the IRC daemon and IRC services daemon), as well as fixing any bugs that crop up in stock code.

Currently the Coding Department is made up of:

 * Stuart Walsh (cryogen)
 * Timothy J Fontaine (tjfontaine)
 * Luca Filipozzi (luca)

Others from staff are known to contribute from time to time as well. If you're interested in contributing patches to our code bases please be sure to familiarize yourself with our [CodingStyle](/CodingStyle), visit [Subversion](/Subversion), and [CodingProjects](/CodingProjects).

## Documentation in the works ##

This is preminilary documentation, considered to be unstable.

When its stable, we will link it from a more user-prominent place, bear with us!
