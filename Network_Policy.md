# Network Policy

Keep in mind the following things:

 * IRC is not a right
 * IRC is not a democracy
 * OFTC is run by a set of [volunteers](/staff) who are governed by a
[guiding document](/constitution).

The network policy is purposefully vague and ambiguous as to provide us comfortable working room:

 * Users may create and join any channel providing they fit within the rest of this policy
 * Nickname and Channel registration is first come first serve, however exceptions can be made for old/unused channels/nicknames
 * Off topic channels should be [+s](/ChannelModes).  Off topic channels are those not related to the development/use of free and open source software.  Off-topic channels are allowed on the basis that they do not cause disprution to other network users and get minimal attention from OFTC staff
 * Illegal/offensive/pornographic activity is strictly prohibited and offenders will be removed from the network without warning
 * Disputes and problems are to be handled by the operators of a channel and network staff will generally not get involved.  However if the issue is considered to be a network issue, then network action may be taken including removal from the network
