# Network Policy

Keep in mind the following things:

 * IRC is not a right
 * IRC is not a democracy
 * OFTC is run by a set of [volunteers](/staff) who are governed by a
[guiding document](/constitution).

## In a phrase

The network policy, succinctly, is "Don't piss us off".

## In ambiguity

The network policy stated as relatively vaguely and with as much ambiguity as
to provide us comfortable working room:

 * Users may create and join any channel they see fit
 * Nickname and Channel registration is first come first serve
 * Off topic channels should be [+s](/ChannelModes)
 * No illegal activity
 * Stay off our radar
