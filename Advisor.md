Dear recruit,

Congratulations, you've been voted to the position of Network Advisor. If you
wish to accept this position, please read on. If not, please inform a member of
the Network Operating Committee that you do not wish to accept this position at
this time.

## Advisor Guidelines

This is an honourary role and is a privelege, not a responsibility.

Advisors are chosen from among outstanding members of the Network or of the
community at large, whether they be current or former staff, or a common user
with no previous connection to the Network's Staff, who do not have the time to
devote to the Network's operations, but have made meaningful contributions to
the Network or to the Community at large.

Advisors may be asked to provide advice to the Network Operating Committee, but
are not expected to fill any formal role or task. However, it must be noted that
what an Advisor says about the Network could be interpreted as the position of
the Network and Advisors are asked to be careful in this regards.

All Advisors are invited to attend NOC meetings at their discretion, and add
comments or questions through the NOC Chairperson.

An Advisor may be stripped of the title if he or she misrepresents the Network
or the positions of the Network.

If you have questions, suggestions, or comments about your role, feel free to
contact other members of the [Staff](/staff).
